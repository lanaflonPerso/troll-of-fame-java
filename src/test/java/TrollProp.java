Look for any unit test you have where some values are "pretty much random" and replace them with invariance tests where these "random values" are actually injected by the library. The benefit is twofold: you make it explicit to the reader that some values are irrelevant, and the PBT library will actually check many values to ensure the value is irrelevant ;-)

   * Another use case for analogous properties are refactoring: instead of modifying an existing function `foo`, copy its implementation to `foo2`, then modify `foo2`, and eventually check that no matter the input `x`, `foo x == foo2 x`, which ensures we did not bring any regression during refactoring! Then you can safely remove `foo` and rename `foo2` to `foo`
